# Mathlan-Mount
A tiny script to mount mathlan quickly

sshfs must be installed for this to work ([OSx link](https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/wiki/SSHFS))

`git clone https://github.com/YourFin/Mathlan-Mount.git`

`cd Mathlan-Mount`

`./mountmath.sh $USERNAME` where `$USERNAME` is your mathlan username.

You should be prompted first for your computer password, and then your mathlan password.
